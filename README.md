# Oddslot
A quick crawler to get profitable matches from Oddslot.com

# Usage
Simply run without any arguments: `ruby game_results_manager.rb`

# How it works
Bets from oddslot.com are picked by real people. Not all bets posted by them will be profitable in a long run. There are some _leagues_, or some _% chance_ that prove to be picked with too much of enthusiasm by the crew. So I did this crawler that runs through last 80 or so pages and checks which _leagues_ are the best analyzed by the oddslot.com crew, and which _% chance_ do they give to these matches.
